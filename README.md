XBRL Tutorial
=============

This repository contains:
- A tutorial in PDF format for making oneself familiar with the XBRL connector on top of the 28.io platform. A direct link is [here](https://github.com/28msec/project-xbrl-tutorial-queries/blob/master/tutorial/en-US/out/pdf/BizQLTutorial.pdf?raw=true)

- The queries used in this tutorial. These queries can be directly uploaded to a 28.io project using the [28 command line](https://github.com/28msec/28). How to connect to an XBRL/NoLAP repository is explained in the PDF above.

Important note
==============
The queries and the tutorial are not quite up-to-date and major improvements are on the way. With the next 28.io release (expected in May), a new version of the tutorial will be released as well.
