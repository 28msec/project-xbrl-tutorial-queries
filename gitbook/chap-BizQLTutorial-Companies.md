#Entities
Companies submit fiscal filings (which are archives) to the FSA.

In the XBRL world, companies correspond to reporting *entities*. The entities interface provides metadata, such as name, ticker, etc, about the entities against which data has been stored in the cell store.

Entities can be identified by ticker, by EDINET code, by stock index or by a regulation authority specific Entity ID.

The rest of this section is showing developers how to use the entities interface to retrieve entity in a format understandable ty computers. If you are not a developer, you can stop reading now and jump to the next section.

##Looking Up A Company
Let us begin with a very simple query that just retrieves a company, say, Canon. Canon's ticker is 7751.


 Example - Canon

```REST
http://edinet.28.io/v1/_queries/public/api/entities.jq?ticker=7751
```

If you look at the output, you will see that it's JSON. It contains some meta information such as the time of the request, and some statistics. In this example, the database contains 10 entities, and one is being returned.
The entities that have been requested (in this case just one) are in the Entities array. All other endpoints have this same structure (metainformation and array containing results).

    {
      "Comment" : "Generated by 28.io, for more information see http://www.28.io/xbrl (2015-02-17T17:08:33.211081Z)",
      "Statistics" : {
        "NumEntities" : 1,
        "TotalNumEntities" : 10
      },
      "Entities" : [ ... ]
    }

##Output formats

The data can also be obtained in other formats, such as XML, HTML and CSV.

```REST
http://edinet.28.io/v1/_queries/public/api/entities.jq?ticker=7751&format=xml
```

```REST
http://edinet.28.io/v1/_queries/public/api/entities.jq?ticker=7751&format=csv
```

```REST
http://edinet.28.io/v1/_queries/public/api/entities.jq?ticker=7751&format=html
```

##Other ways of identifying a company

You can identify a company with its EDINET code like so:

```REST
http://edinet.28.io/v1/_queries/public/api/entities.jq?edinetcode=E02274
```

Also, companies all have some EIDs that are used by regulatory authorities. These EIDs are used to associate each fact to the entity that this fact applies to.

An EID is always made of an URI scheme followed by an identifier. For example, this is the TDNET EID of Canon:

    http://www.tse.or.jp/sicc 77510

Although it is less common and not very practical, you can use the eid parameter to retrieve an entity with its EID. You will need to URL-encode the space with %20, as well as any other special characters that might be in here.

```REST
http://edinet.28.io/v1/_queries/public/api/entities.jq?eid=http://www.tse.or.jp/sicc%2077510
```

##Getting companies by stock index

You can retrieve all companies in an index with a single call. Here is an example with the NIKKEI:

```REST
http://edinet.28.io/v1/_queries/public/api/entities.jq?tag=NIKKEI
```

##Mixing parameters

If you use multiple parameters, it will accumulate the companies as you add more parameters:

```REST
http://edinet.28.io/v1/_queries/public/api/entities.jq?edinetcode=E02274&ticker=9432&tag=NIKKEI
```
